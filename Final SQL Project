Hi! These are the answers to the example questions for my final SQL project 

--1 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

--2 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceID, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

--3 How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-21';

--4 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.Lastname,
ROUND(SUM(Inv,Total), as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepID = emp.EmployeeID

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv
ON Inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;
