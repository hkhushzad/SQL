# For this project I downloaded Spotify data from Break Into Tech's curriculum
# Then I created a table to insert spotify data
# Finally I performed data analytics on the data using SQL

# Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted spotify data. csv into the table
#Next , I explored the data using the following SQL

--1 What is the average danceability by artist and track? 
SELECT avg(danceability), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY artist_name


--2 Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

--3 What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata


--4 What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

--5 WHAT artist released the shortest song in terms of duration?
SELECT artist_name, MIN(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

--6 Who are the top 10 artists based on energy?
SELECT artist_name, energy 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy  desc
LIMIT 10;
